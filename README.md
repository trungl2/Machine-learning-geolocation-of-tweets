# Machine-learning-geolocation-of-tweets
This repository contains a report that uses various machine learning techniques in order geolocate tweets geolocation 

How to run:
1) all the files in this repository besides "ML project 2 report"
2) ensure all of the above file are in the same folder
3) run all the code in "Linear Regression and NB.ipynb" and "Location Lexicon" using "Jupyter Notebook"

Note:
- "dev-top100", "test-top50", "test-top100", "train-top50" and "train-top100" were all excluded in this repository because of file size
constraints, this would only effect some of the outcomes in running "Linear Regression and NB.ipynb". This can be ignored and the results
can be seen in the report
